# Emacs Rails

## Note: DO NOT USE

This will probably take some time before it will be better than other available
tools for working with Rails on Emacs.

At first my focus is on making navigation of Rails projects fast. I'm a massive
fan of Rails.vim. I'm very efficient with it and continue to use it daily
because it's simply the best environment for hacking Rails applications, but
I'm currently into Emacs and would like something as nice.

So hold onto your butts...
